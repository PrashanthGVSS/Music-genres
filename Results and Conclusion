Results:

The classification report and accuracy score reveal how well the model differentiates between various music genres.
The results would typically show the precision, recall, and F1-score for each genre, providing an idea of which genres are easier or more challenging to classify.



Conclusion:
Overall Model Accuracy:
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 53.56% on the PCA-transformed data, meaning it correctly predicted the genre of a music track in about 54% of cases.
This moderate accuracy suggests the model could distinguish between genres to a certain extent but also indicates room for improvement.
